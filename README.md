# Product-Demand-Prediction-
A product company planned to offer discounts on its product during the upcoming holiday season. The company wanted to find the price at which its product can be a better deal compared to its competitors. For this task, the company provided a dataset of past changes in sales based on price changes. I needed to train a model that could predict the demand for the product in the market with different price segments.
The dataset for this task contains data about:

the product id;
store id;
total price at which product was sold;
base price at which product was sold;
Units sold (quantity demanded)
